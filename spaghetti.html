  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
     Spaghetti Bolognese is one of the most beloved Italian pasta dishes, known for its rich and hearty meat sauce. 
     The slow-simmered tomato and beef mixture creates a flavorful base that clings perfectly to strands of spaghetti. 
     With a blend of garlic, onion, and herbs, this recipe is simple enough for a weeknight dinner but special enough 
     to serve to guests. It’s comfort food at its best—warm, filling, and delicious.
