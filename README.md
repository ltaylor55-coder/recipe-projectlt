# recipe-projectlt

## Description
This is a simple web project for my Web Programming class.  
It showcases **three recipes**: Spaghetti Bolognese, Cheese Omelet, and Fresh Garden Salad.  
Each recipe page includes a title, image, description, ingredients list, steps, and a link back to the main page.


## Future Improvements
- Add more recipes and categories.   
- Include a search feature for recipes.  
- Make interactive features such as checkboxes.


## Learning Outcomes
- Practice structuring HTML pages consistently.  
- Learn to organize a web project with folders for images.
- Understand linking between pages and navigation.  
- Apply good coding practices like commit messages.

- Due to me not feeling well over the course of this week, I wasn't keeping track of progression and I did not like my first project so I started over today. Here is a screenshot over the course of today on mme completing the assignment.
